- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zackng96

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science-based approaches to analyse geotechnical problems in civil engineering. I am particularly interested in the combined use of traditional intrusive techniques such as boreholes and geophysical means to reduce subsurface uncertainty. Currently updating my repositories with past side projects which I embarked on during undergraduate coursework.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning how to process seismic data using seismological modules such as ObsPy and Madagascar
